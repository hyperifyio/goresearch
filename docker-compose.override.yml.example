# Example override to expose services on localhost for troubleshooting.
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.example up -d
# Note: Not used by default; base compose keeps services on an internal network with no host ports.

services:
  llm-openai:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"   # expose OpenAI-compatible API on localhost:8080

  searxng:
    ports:
      - "8888:8080"   # expose SearxNG web UI/API on localhost:8888
