# Example override to expose services on localhost for troubleshooting.
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml.example up -d
# Note: Not used by default; base compose keeps services on an internal network with no host ports.

networks:

services:
  searxng:

      - "8080:8080"   # expose SearxNG web UI/API on localhost:8080

  # Optionally publish LocalAI on localhost:1235 (avoids clashing with stub)
  llm-openai:

  # Publish the stub LLM on localhost:1234 for fast smoke tests
