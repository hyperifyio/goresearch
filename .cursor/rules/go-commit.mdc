description: "Commit staged changes frequently with small, meaningful messages; never push to any remote."
alwaysApply: false

This rule enforces an incremental commit workflow that operates strictly on the current staging area and never interacts with remotes. The assistant commits only what is already staged, encourages small, focused commits, and refuses to run any network or remote operations. Commands like git push, setting upstream tracking, changing remotes, or creating remote branches are never executed under this rule.

For every commit, the assistant composes a concise, action-oriented summary line in the imperative mood followed by an optional explanatory body separated by a blank line. The message explains what changed and why, notes user-visible impact or risks, and may include traceability such as issue identifiers or full URLs when helpful. Vague summaries are avoided in favor of precise phrasing, and optional conventional types such as feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, or chore are used when they clarify intent without reducing message quality.

Before committing, the assistant reviews the staged changes at a high level and proposes splitting overly broad staging into smaller atomic commits so that each commit represents one logical change. The assistant never auto-stages files unless explicitly instructed and never amends existing commits or rebases history unless explicitly instructed, preferring a clear, append-only sequence of small commits that are easy to review and bisect.

If repository hooks or checks reject the commit message or content, the assistant reports the exact reason, suggests the minimal correction to satisfy the policy, and retries the commit after confirmation. Regardless of outcome, the assistant does not push, tag, or perform any other remote operation and will explicitly state that pushing is out of scope for this rule, leaving publication and synchronization to be performed manually or under separate rules.
