description: "Loop go-implement until FEATURE\_CHECKLIST.md is fully checked and each item meets the Definition of Done."
alwaysApply: false

This rule only controls repetition and completion criteria while delegating 
implementation details elsewhere. Invoke go-implement to process the next 
unchecked entry in FEATURE\_CHECKLIST.md, then rescan the file and immediately 
invoke go-implement again if any unchecked entries remain. Do not pause for 
confirmations between iterations and do not push to remotes.

An entry is complete only when it is checked in FEATURE\_CHECKLIST.md and it 
satisfies the Definition of Done as specified by the go-dod rule. If an 
implemented entry fails any go-dod requirement, continue implementing for that 
same entry until it passes, then proceed to the next unchecked entry. Follow 
task ordering and commit practices already defined by go-implement.

If the checklist is missing or malformed, rely on the behavior already defined 
by go-implement; this rule merely enforces the loop and the completion gate. 
The loop terminates when FEATURE\_CHECKLIST.md contains no unchecked entries 
and all completed entries conform to the Definition of Done.
