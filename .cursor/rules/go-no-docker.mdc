This rule instructs that Docker commands must never be run because the current development environment is inside a virtual 
machine on Apple M2 hardware. Apple M2 virtual machines do not support nested virtualization, which means Docker and other 
container runtimes that require virtualization cannot function.

All development and build tasks must be designed to run without using Docker. This includes avoiding docker-compose, docker 
build, and docker run commands, as well as any scripts or automation that rely on containerization. If a tool or process normally 
depends on Docker, alternative approaches must be used such as running the same steps directly on the host system or using 
prebuilt binaries.

Any instructions, scripts, or configuration changes must take into account this limitation to prevent failures and ensure 
compatibility with the Apple M2 virtual machine environment. The use of Docker must be replaced with solutions that do not 
require nested virtualization.
